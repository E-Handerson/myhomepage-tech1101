        <div class='width75'>
        <p>I am a 51 year old disabled single mother of a wonderful 14 year old child who is in grade 9. 
            I was born in Toronto, and moved to Calgary when I was 3. I spent many years moving back and forth between Calgary and Toronto.
        </p>
        <p>I did not complete high school, but I did attend DeVry University from 1992 - 1995, trying to determine 
            what I wanted to do with my life. During my time at DeVry, I took courses from the Electronic Technician course, then the 
            Engineering Electronic Technologist course and then moved in to the Computer Information Systems course hoping to obtain 
            my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. By the time I realized my love of software development, I had to leave DeVry 
            Universtiy for personal reasons. I attempted to complete my education at CDI College in 1995/1996, and ultimately was unable 
            to graduate due to financial circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>I entered the world of IT in retail in 1996, and moved through numerous companies and positions throughout my 
            career. I eventually sort out my financial issues and return to CDI College in 2003 to take a course in the Programmer Analyst/Internet 
            Solutions Developer course where I ultimately graduated with an overall grade of 92% and honors. During my time at CDI College, 
            I was also voted in as the Student Council President where I launched several initiatives, one of which was having students volunteer 
            their time at the Calgary Drop In Center to help out with less fortunate people in learning computer skills and creating resumes. 
            There were times when I was also asked by the lead instructor to monitor the class when she had to take a break or leave the college 
            campus for a bit. I also mentored the other Developers, the Networking Administrators as well as many of the Business Students in 
            computer and networking skills.
        </p>
        <p>I achieved a great many certifications during my 25+ years in the IT Industry, I was invited by Microsoft to 
            publish articles on the TechNet blog, and nominated as an MVP for Microsoft System Center: Service Manager application. 
            There were many other applications, operating systems, and automation skills I was recognized for.
        </p>
        <p>In 2015, my life kind of fell apart. My marriage of 11 years ended and my souse moved out. Less than a month later, 
            I was laid off during a downturn in the economy. After a few more weeks, I was involved in an incident that left me in a coma for 
            10 days, and disabled for the remainder of my life. In 2016, I lost everything except my house. In 2017, the long road to recover began, 
            and I found a position. I also discovered what real discrimination was, since I faced it for being disabled now. I had always faced 
            some level of issue as a woman in a STEM field, I was never truly taken seriously, no matter how smart I was, or how many certificates 
            I possessed, or how many achievements I accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>I ultimately found another position as a help desk agent, and in 2020, I was laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
            cutbacks, and took a year off to read for enjoyment. During that year, I lost myself in books and novels for enjoyment, something I 
            hadn't done in 15 or so years. I ended up reading a total of 42 books and shocked myself. 
        </p>
        <p>I decided to return to school to complete some High School Upgrading so I could finally go back to university 
            to obtain a degree, but decided that given my age, I didn't want to end up graduating from school with only enough time to pay off 
            student loans and have no money left for retirement. This lead me to the Software Development Diploma course I am taking now.
        </p>
